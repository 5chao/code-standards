<section><h1 id="front-end-code-standards">Front-End Code Standards</h1>
<h2 id="general-introduction">General Introduction</h2>
<p>This document contains the guidelines and best practices for the front-end web development team at Isobar. </p>
<p>Each item here represents either:</p>
<ol>
<li>A reminder to follow existing standards or industry conventions,</li>
<li>Guidance on what constitutes professional patterns and organization, or </li>
<li>A decision we&#39;ve made favoring one method over its alternatives.</li>
</ol>
<p>What this document is <em>not</em> is a series of explanations as to how front-end technologies work; a basic familiarity is assumed. It also does <em>not</em> provide evaluations of the pros and cons of various alternatives; when appropriate we pick what we consider to be the best solutions and present them. Issues that don&#39;t yet have a clear solution are considered flexible and may or may not be listed.</p>
<aside class="box">
<p>It&#39;s recognized that the same conventions for all projects, clients, and teams isn&#39;t practical. For these reasons forks of this document are encouraged for various projects and teams.</p>
<p>What works well can be submitted and discussed as new recommendations moving forward.</p>
</aside>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>Our motivations in creating this document are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Foster code consistency across our projects </li>
<li>Facilitate ease of maintenance</li>
<li>Guide staff on-boarding or educate new developers</li>
<li>Ensure we create professional, robust, performant, and accessible websites</li>
</ol>
<p>This document is not intended to replace common sense, conventions requested by particular clients, teams, or prevent expressive or creative solutions to problems. Team or project-specific agreements or client requests will always supersede this document&#39;s content.</p>
<h4 id="professional-responsibility">Professional Responsibility</h4>
<p>We are experts in our field creating solutions for our clients and their target audiences, not for ourselves. Every technology and code choice needs to be measured against the potential benefits to the project objectives and  maintainability versus the <em>cool factor</em> or how <em>trendy</em> a particular solution may be. </p>
<p>Our industry is wrought with the flavor of the month, so please be deliberate. </p>
<p>Always remember that just because you <em>can</em> does not mean you <em>should</em>. Some solutions are not reliable, may not perform well, or may be difficult to maintain over time or add more code to. Always remember your code may not be the last added to a project in that particular feature area.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>At the outset of the project it is essential to properly understand the goals of the project and identify the specific deliverables expected of the front-end team. Where your responsibilities begin and end should not be taken for granted or assumed.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to understand how the development environment will work, what tools will be available, and what the differences between development, test, and production environments may ultimately be.</p>
<p>Finally, all project teams should get a reasonable understanding of the what client&#39;s browser and device requirements are. Make no assumptions as to the technology available either from the client or their audience.</p>
<h4 id="pillars-of-front-end-development">Pillars of Front-end Development</h4>
<p>Whenever possible, the front-end technology solutions produced shall adhere to an industry best practice honoring as strict a separation of concerns as possible between:</p>
<ul>
<li>A semantic HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for structure</li>
<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for presentation</li>
<li>JavaScript (JS) for behavior and interaction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="general-standards">General Standards</h3>
<p>For any project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency and conventions between team members is paramount</li>
<li>Solutions should be as simple and clear as possible, while serving a specific purpose</li>
<li>Clever does not necessarily mean good; readability is <em>critical</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A key hallmark of professional code includes a notion that while we are writing code that must reach a desired goal, we are also creating code that must be read and understood by others.</p>
<h4 id="code-consistency">Code Consistency</h4>
<p>Usage of the same patterns is critical between files, file types, and between team members so as to never deviate from expectations or cause confusion.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth establishing conventions at the project start or enabling automatic settings in the build or editor environments that might enforce particular rules.</p>
<h4 id="indentation">Indentation</h4>
<p>Please consistently indent, nest, include braces, quotes, and new lines so that code is clear and can be read easily. New code that is added should never deviate from existing formatting conventions or change the indent levels.</p>
<p>For all code languages, we recommend the use soft tabs comprised of four spaces per tab. Hitting the Tab key in your text editor should generate four space characters rather than one tab character. This results in our code appearing identical across platforms.</p>
<p>If tab stops are favored by a team, simply <em>maintain consistency</em> for a project and it&#39;s deliverables so developers can make adjustments to their editing environments a <em>single</em> time.</p>
<h4 id="readability">Readability</h4>
<p>We encourage liberal use of whitespace, comments, and descriptive variable names as appropriate for writing easy-to-read code. There is no need to write code in an obfuscated or compressed way for the purpose of file-size savings; we will use automated server-side or other build processes to concatenate, minify, and gzip all static client-side code (such as CSS and JavaScript).</p>
<h4 id="third-party-libraries">Third-Party Libraries</h4>
<p>Un-minified libraries and third-party scripts should be leveraged in local development environments for easier debugging if available. The code should be committed to source control in an unmodified state, or simply referenced in dependency management components that resolve the files in a build. The final products will be compressed with the rest of the source for delivery.</p>
<p>Likewise, third-party code and libraries should never be modified and their original source and the license must be documented and be appropriate for a project. Any changes to third party code must be agreed upon and must be for specific reasons. If changes are mandated by bug fixes then the appropriate upstream project should have the changes submitted (assuming the code is part of an open source repository).</p>
<p>Library code should be treated as an external dependency and should be considered something that may need to be wholesale updated or replaced at a later time.</p>
<p>Inclusion of any third-party code should be carefully considered and verified with the project team as the appropriate solution to a given problem. &quot;Adding another plug-in&quot; is not always the best solution. Finally, selection of third party libraries should be done carefully and not be out of alignment with the nature of the problem being addressed. </p>
<p>To be blunt, <em>use the right tool for the right job</em>.</p>
<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<p>Quality deliverables are essential for professionals. Sloppy or messy deliverables are unprofessional and reflect poorly on the final product and the delivery team. Please remove legacy files, be certain the work is delivered in a clean file system, and in an orderly, logical structure that serves a clear purpose.</p>
</section>
<section><h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
<p>HTML markup defines the content of a document and gives it a rudimentary structure such as section dividers, headers, paragraphs, lists, menus, and forms.</p>
<h3 id="goals-for-markup">Goals for Markup</h3>
<p>Please follow conventions established for a given project so all team members can have the same expectations around document structure and markup.</p>
<p>Structural consistency is critical when talking about the types of pages being used on a site or in a Web app. The markup stucture provides all the necessary hooks for scripting and behavior, so it&#39;s important that the appropriate hooks are in place.</p>
<p>A clear, clean, and concise HTML structure is also necessary for semantics, flexibility, and a reliable deployment environment. Do <strong>not</strong> deviate from established templates or patterns without architect approval.</p>
<p>Which markup is used does matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the most <em>meaningful</em> yet <em>minimal</em> markup required to present the styles and interaction required</li>
<li>Application-centric deliverables often have different types of requirements; please code accordingly </li>
<li>Maintain a clear separation of concerns, avoid inline styles and inline JavaScript whenever possible</li>
<li>Have reference implementations so that each team member knows what sorts of structures are appropriate, as well as where to add new code</li>
<li>Adhere to Web standards and avoid proprietary markup unless agreed upon</li>
<li>Build pages in such a way that blocks of code can be broken up and reused when implemented</li>
<li>Be sure front-end code is compatible with destination environments and delivery platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>The flexible nature of HTML markup and how losely browsers interpret markup sometimes lends itself to inconsistencies not always being discovered immediately. This belies the care necessary in crafting a document&#39;s structure and in following established patterns.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started-on-markup">Getting Started on Markup</h3>
<p>When crafting the HTML for a website, environment or technical constraints may impact the type of markup that can be used. Please discuss the final delivery environment in depth with technical leads and clients so that pages are not structured or styled in some way that is not effective for the project solution. </p>
<p>Discuss types of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Templates and types of pages</li>
<li>Which sections of pages are reused or managed by software vs. by hand</li>
<li>Frameworks, CSS grid systems (custom or otherwise)</li>
<li>Server-Side delivery platforms</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that it is vital to take into account how the site will ultimately be maintained and who will be doing that work.</em></p>
<h3 id="general-markup-standards">General Markup Standards</h3>
<p>As noted these guidelines are flexible for projects as long as consensus or need determines a particular path, consistency is what matters most.</p>
<p>Indent nested elements and tags with single indentation settings, whatever they may be, for each level in the hierarchy of the document.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsumLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
        consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="semantic-markup">Semantic Markup</h4>
<p>HTML provides a number of semantic constructs that allow automated tools like search engines and screen readers to make sense of the document and to understand relationships between pieces of content. Use <em>semantic</em> markup whenever possible — that is to say use elements with specific meanings for specific purposes to convey the spirit of the markup. </p>
<p>A well-written HTML document will make appropriate use of these semantic elements and leave all responsibility for controlling the presentation of the document to the CSS stylesheet. </p>
<h4 id="validation">Validation</h4>
<p>Valid markup is a goal but not a mandate. Please have reasons for invalid markup if this is a concern. </p>
<h4 id="html-standards-and-browser-support">HTML Standards and Browser Support</h4>
<p>All markup will be written using the latest HTML5 markup specifications from the W3C, as implemented by browsers and devices that meet project requirements. When creating markup be sure that the target environments support the techniques being implemented, or that there is a fall-back plan.</p>
<p>Please use a common HTML5 polyfill or HTML5 Shiv to enable styling and recognition of HTML5 elements in older devices&#39; browsers.</p>
<h4 id="doctype">Doctype</h4>
<p>Always include a proper doctype to trigger standards mode. Omitting the doctype triggers quirks mode and should always be avoided. The HTML5 doctype is simple and easy to remember.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="character-encoding">Character Encoding</h4>
<p>All markup should be delivered as UTF-8, since it has the best support for internationalization. The character encoding should be designated in both the HTTP header and the head of the document via a meta tag. If the server happens to omit the HTTP header, browsers can take a guess at the character encoding and begins parsing and rendering the markup in a particular way. If there are inconsistencies, the browser will re-parse and re-render, throwing away all that work and starting over if it encounters the meta tag and its guess was incorrect. As a best practice, we always put the meta tag as early in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag as early as possible — however server-settings are ideal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="optional-and-self-closing-tags">Optional and Self-closing Tags</h4>
<p>While current standards designate certain closing elements and even document level elements as optional, use all open and closing elements nested in the correct ways to ensure maximum compatibility and clarity of document structure. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, self-closing XML (i.e. XHTML, XML) style tags are not necessary.</p>
<h4 id="html5-elements">HTML5 Elements</h4>
<p>To provide additional semantic value to our documents, make use of HTML5 elements such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> where appropriate. However, in cases where the HTML needs to be as backwards-compatible as possible, do not apply IDs or classes to them, since older browsers do not understand these elements by default and will not apply styling to them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;site-header&quot;&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="attribute-values">Attribute Values</h4>
<p>Use quotes to surround all attribute values in HTML, despite quotes being optional in HTML5. This maintains consistency between attribute values that contain whitespace and those that don&#39;t.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;form class=&quot;registration module&quot; action=&quot;/register&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="ids-vs-classes">IDs vs. Classes</h4>
<p>HTML elements can be identified by using the <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> attributes. An ID is a unique identifier for that particular element; no other element on the page should use the same ID. This uniqueness allows <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements to associate themselves with a particular input and URLs to jump to a particular scroll position on a page. Classes are not unique. The same class can be used on multiple elements within a page, and a single element can have more than one class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;ul id=&quot;categories&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;category&quot;&gt;Jackets&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;category&quot;&gt;Accessories&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;category&quot;&gt;Shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
<p>When coming up with names for an ID or class, we use semantic names like &quot;secondary-nav&quot; or &quot;primary-button&quot; that describe what the element is, rather than names like &quot;left-nav&quot; or &quot;blue-button&quot; that describe what the element looks like, which can change over time. We also use <em>lowercase names with hyphens</em> separating words as opposed to camelCase or underscores.</p>
<h4 id="anchors">Anchors</h4>
<p>All anchor links should point to absolute or relative URLs with user-readable content. Do not link to XML or JSON resources that are designed to be Ajaxed by JavaScript instead of navigated to directly, and do not put JavaScript in an anchor&#39;s <code>href</code> attribute like <code>javascript:loadPage(2);</code>. This allows search engines to index the content, allows the user to open the links in a new tab or window, and means the links will still work when JavaScript is broken, disabled, or not supported. This will require that the back-end be able to return a full HTML page for each important content state (e.g. sorting a table column).</p>
<h4 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h4>
<p>Avoid using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags to separate paragraphs or lines of text. Use <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> instead with proper opening and closing elements.</p>
<h4 id="definition-lists">Definition Lists</h4>
<p>Use definition lists to display a single record of name-value pairs, like a contact card.</p>
<h4 id="tables">Tables</h4>
<p>Tables should not be used for page layout; only use them when you need to display tabular data. Tables provide an important semantic association (used mostly by screen readers for the sight-impaired) between row/column headers and their data, so use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> rather than other elements when displaying multiple records of data.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element is the recommended way to describe a table for both sighted and sight-impaired users, though this can also be done less semantically in the normal page text around the table. Use the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> elements to denote which row contains column headers so when a user prints the website and the table runs onto another page, browsers can display the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> on each page for easier readability. Remember to use the <code>scope</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> element to indicate whether the header applies to the row or column.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;First two U.S. presidents&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Took office&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;George Washington&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;April 30, 1789&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;n/a&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;John Adams&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;March 4, 1797&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Federalist&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="forms">Forms</h4>
<p>For both semantic and functional reasons, we make full use of the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag for all sections requiring user input. All form <code>action</code> attributes should point to URLs with user-readable content, so they will still work if the form is submitted by the user before JavaScript has loaded on a page, or if JavaScript is broken, disabled, or not supported. This will require that the back-end be able to return a full HTML page for form submission (e.g. registering a new user, editing the quantity in a shopping cart).</p>
<p>Do not nest HTML form elements.</p>
<h4 id="input-labels">Input Labels</h4>
<p>All input fields should be associated with a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element. The <code>for</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element should contain the ID of the corresponding input field. This means the input field will receive focus when a user clicks the label and also enables screen readers for sight-impaired users to read out an appropriate description of the input field.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;label for=&quot;home-address&quot;&gt;Home Address&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id=&quot;home-address&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id="markup-deliverables">Markup Deliverables</h3>
<p>Typically HTML deliverables are incorporated into Content Management Systems or application delivery platforms as templates. A plan for incorporation of templates that leverage patterns created during the markup creation phase should be followed and matching types of pages to templates that were created, so that an association between the source markup and the destination markup can be maintained over time.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps-amp-html5-resources">Next Steps &amp; HTML5 Resources</h3>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Site maintenance procedures</li>
<li>Browser testing strategies</li>
<li>How new features will be added</li>
<li>Where new features will be added</li>
<li>What the file system looks like for static site assets</li>
<li>If a CDN is involved</li>
<li>Naming conventions and organization of graphics and photography assets</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section><h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is where the visual presentation and design rules for a website belong. Well-written CSS makes good use of its cascading nature - general styles are applied first, and those styles are overridden for more specific instances as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="goals-for-effective-css">Goals for Effective CSS</h3>
<p>CSS is an unusual language which can easily lead to code bloat, inconsistencies in design or clashing code techniques. It is easy to end up with CSS code that is so fragile it can cause site-wide regressions with small changes.</p>
<p>CSS should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be easy to maintain.</li>
<li>Follow clear enough patterns to understand.</li>
<li>Offer a clear place for new styles going forwards.</li>
<li>Not be a drag on page loading performance.</li>
<li>Not include unused style rules.</li>
<li>Address different devices, browser versions, and do as much as it can with as little code as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>When setting up the CSS for a site, always consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the default styles for HTML elements are going to be.</li>
<li>Which styles are global styles versus specific one-off use-cases.</li>
<li>Distinctions between code for layout and for content.</li>
<li>How the code will evole and grow.</li>
<li>Potential impact of bug fixes on the overall site.</li>
<li>Use of images as CSS background images vs. inline HTML (content).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-started-with-css">Getting Started with CSS</h3>
<p>Planning for a CSS build isn&#39;t that different than any other software requirements for Web development. A solid foundation starting point is critcal.</p>
<p>Before coding, you should always:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the design.</li>
<li>Plan around technical constraints.</li>
<li>Identify how content will be managed.</li>
<li>Be certain who will be able to modify the design directly via code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to segment code in logical ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate page grids and containers from the content.</li>
<li>Create baseline components which may be extended by other styles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Baseline components should rarely be modified directly.</p>
<p>More specifically, you may have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core brand styles.</li>
<li>Basic typography or default HTML rules.</li>
<li>Site-wide styles.</li>
<li>Distinct sections of the site.</li>
<li>Micro-sites and landing pages.</li>
<li>Components, widgets, or re-usable modules.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p>Sometimes a third party library helpful — but please be certain to not include extra code for no reason other than personal enjoyment. Libraries or tools should be picked based on the advantages they provide.</p>
<p>Common types CSS-related tools might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>File concatentation</li>
<li>Precompilers</li>
<li>Minifiers</li>
<li>Post processors</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be considered in the context of the rest of the site construction, back-end, and continuous integration processes. Discuss the options with the technical lead on the project.</p>
<p>Be careful as these tools can also introduce unnecessary complexity unless used wisely.</p>
<h4 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h4>
<p>Pre-built UI components or CSS frameworks can be beneficial, however just like any third party code please choose wisely and based on benefit of features and flexibility. Locking development into a library that unintentionally imposes limits is not good.</p>
<p>Some examples of third party frameworks might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI component or widget libraries (e.g. Foundation, Bootstrap, jQuery UI)</li>
<li>Grid Systems</li>
<li>Typography adjustments</li>
<li>Normalizing code </li>
</ul>
<aside class="box">
<p>External libraries should always be assessed for the pros/cons and potential benefits, vs. the barrier to entry and level of effort involved in their usage. </p>
<p>For instance, a grid system may not match the grids in the design, and it may not be adjustable enough for a given design.</p>
</aside>

<h4 id="establishing-conventions-and-development-strategies">Establishing Conventions and Development Strategies</h4>
<p>Like other aspects of the code on a site, consistency is key. Areas of critical consistency might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding techniques</li>
<li>Naming conventions</li>
<li>File and folder structure</li>
<li>Examples or sample code</li>
</ul>
<p>On a large site never develop using a single CSS style sheet, though a single file served for a page is best. To this end we often recommend the use of CSS preprocessors to break stylesheets into smaller, better organized files, or the use of a build process to combine files for serving via HTTP.</p>
<h5 id="living-style-guides-and-reference-implementations">Living Style Guides and Reference Implementations</h5>
<p>One technique to consider is maintaining static HTML style reference implementations well into integration with server-side / back-end systems. These could be a series of templates or widgets that use the live styles being built. This helps reduce regressions that can happen across the board as the code for the site evolves. Continue to test these reference implementations as they will be the &quot;source of record&quot; for the styles created on the site. They also allow you to more easily distinguish the front-end bugs from the bugs potentially intriduced by integration with a complex back-end.</p>
<p>These refernece implementations can serve as a <em>living style guide</em> and broken components are easily spotted in testing over time.</p>
<p>Defining a solid style guide to be applied to tag names can significantly reduce the size of the CSS if that styleguide is adhered to by both the design and development teams. It is recommended that a styleguide is agreed upon at the beginning of a project, defined in HTML and then iterated on by both the design and development teams.</p>
<h3 id="general-css-standards">General CSS Standards</h3>
<p>What follows are some basic concepts for standardization of CSS code. Naturally, feel free to fork, update per project, and even issue pull requests for further discussion based upon experience.</p>
<h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>
<p>Use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to include all your stylesheets in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document. For optimal page performance, concatenate your CSS into as few files as possible and do not use the <code>@import</code> command to include other stylesheets, as this will fire an additional HTTP request and block page rendering until its completion.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;main.css&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="formatting-css">Formatting CSS</h4>
<p>Basic rules for formatting CSS files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a new line for every selector and every declaration.</li>
<li>Use a single space before the opening brace in a set of rules.</li>
<li>Use lowercase for elemnts and shorthand hex values, e.g., <code>#aaa</code>.</li>
<li>Hyphenate class selector names; avoid underscores and camelCase </li>
<li>Quote attribute values in selectors</li>
<li>Use one level of indentation for each declaration.</li>
<li>The closing brace of declaration goes in the same column as the first character of the set of rules.</li>
<li>Use a single blank line between sets of rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside sets of rules or style declarations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a single space between the property and value, for example:<br>
<code>prop: value;</code> and <em>not</em> <code>prop:value;</code>.</li>
<li>Use double quotes for quoted values</li>
<li>Always include a semi-colon at the end of the last declaration.</li>
<li>Use shorthand if you can, like:<br>
 <code>padding: 15px 0;</code> and <em>not</em> <code>padding: 15px 0px 15px 0px;</code></li>
<li>When allowed, use <code>0</code> without units.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting each selector on its own line and each property on its own line is great for readability and so version control systems can clearly show which parts have changed in a diff.</p>
<p>The attributes within a selector can be alphabetized for easy scanning and so that compression algorithms like gzip have a greater chance of finding repeatable patterns.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<!-- do we want more examples to cover most of the notes above? -->

<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="class">.content</span> <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">margin-left</span>:<span class="value"> -<span class="number">2</span>%</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span>

<span class="class">.twitter-popular</span>,
<span class="class">.twitter-favorites</span>,
<span class="class">.twitter-feed</span> <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">float</span>:<span class="value"> left</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">padding-left</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">2</span>%</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">width</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">33.33</span>%</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Do not indent child styles underneath their parent styles; this is important for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We usually recommend indenting media queries, so this can cause confusion.</li>
<li>Some CSS preprocessors heavily use indentation.</li>
<li>Various levels of indentation hinders maintainability. </li>
<li>HTML and CSS structure can change frequently over the course of a project, quickly rendering obsolete the parent-child relationship the indentation used to represent.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="specificity">Specificity</h4>
<p>Use the minimum specificity required to acheive the desired style. It can be difficult to quickly read and locate styles or even bugs with heavily nested styles in the CSS.</p>
<p>The ID is the most specific selector, since it can only match one element, and the class is a close second. Use those whenever possible rather than HTML tag names. </p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* BAD */
button#back-button { ... }
.popular ul li a { ... }
.popular &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; a { ... }

/* GOOD */
.back-button { ... }
.popular-link { ... }
.unpopular-link { ... }</code></pre>
<p>As a rule, CSS is most maintainable with the simplest selectors possible. Try applying a class to the element you want to target instead.</p>
<aside class="box">
<p>While performance of CSS selectors has been a debated topic, browsers perform quite well on most types of selectors. That said, specificity reduced to the most simple name to get the desired results is the best idea in most cases <strong>for readabilty</strong> and <strong>maintainabilty</strong>.</p>
</aside>

<h5 id="do-not-use-important">Do Not Use !important</h5>
<p>Avoid using the <code>!important</code> keyword. Treat it like the nuclear option, only to be used in the most extreme of cases. This fundamentally destroys the specificity feature and can even break accessibility for some users.</p>
<p>There is usually another way to achieve the same goal without causing headaches for developers in the future who are either trying to debug a styling issue, or trying to use normal specificity to override a style for a particular element only to find that they can&#39;t.</p>
<h4 id="id-selectors">ID Selectors</h4>
<p>As noted above, use the lowest level of specificity necessary to get the desired results. This means the use of the ID selector should be minimized. Often creating a new class is preferable to using inheritance or additional specificity to target an element or elements. </p>
<p>ID selectors, if used, should be used mainly as access points for JavaScript or if a very particular use case surfaces. Styles and classes can be applied via the same element with a className.</p>
<h4 id="vendor-prefixes">Vendor Prefixes</h4>
<p>When using vendor prefixed features, put the standardized rule at the end to ensure browsers optimize and use the standard if they recognize it. </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="class">.thing</span> <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-webkit-transition</span>:<span class="value"> all <span class="number">100</span>ms</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">transition</span>:<span class="value"> all <span class="number">100</span>ms</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>
<h4 id="inline-styling">Inline Styling</h4>
<p>Do not hard code style information into your HTML markup directly, either with the <code>style</code> attribute that accepts CSS or with deprecated attributes such as <code>align</code>, <code>border</code>, or <code>width</code>. These are difficult to maintain and make it harder to track down what is causing an element to appear as it does.</p>
<h5 id="performance-caveats">Performance Caveats</h5>
<p>In some cases for performance reasons it may be good practice to inline critical styles in a <code>style</code> block in the document&#39;s <code>head</code>. This delivers these styles to the browser in the fastest method possible by preventing the need for an additional HTTP request. Fetching linked style sheets are a blocking operation on the rendering of a Web page in a browser in most cases. An enormous CSS file can mean a highly reduced time to first rendering because a browser may pause during loading of the page to download CSS which may not even be used on the first page. </p>
<p>With the above in mind it may be desirable to include the rules required to render the top portions of a page (i.e. &quot;Above the fold&quot;) in advance of styles loaded after the rendering begins. Critical styles can be identified either manually or through the use of a tool. Non critical styles can then be asynchronously loaded, increasing the perceived page load speed.</p>
<h4 id="box-model">Box Model</h4>
<p>To simplify CSS authoring, we set the <code>box-sizing</code> attribute to <code>border-box</code> for all page elements. This enables us to use round numbers for width like 50% and then apply a padding or border to that same element without needing to</p>
<ol>
<li>adjust the width accordingly using calc (since borders use pixels rather than percents) or</li>
<li>create an element inside it to take the padding and border. This is the only case where we use the inefficient universal selector (<code>*</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">* <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-moz-box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> border-box</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-webkit-box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> border-box</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> border-box</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>
<h4 id="coding-patterns">Coding Patterns</h4>
<p>There are a number of popular design patterns for naming conventions on selectors, groupings or extentions of styles in CSS files. Sometimes these are of value and may be used on projects as long as the developers are on board and they are used consistently by the team. </p>
<aside class="box">
<p>Examples of pattern systems include BEM, SMACSS, Object Oriented CSS, Atomic design, and others.</p>
</aside>

<!-- links? -->

<p>The downsides to some of these systems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often rely on less obvious rules that may be difficult to follow.</li>
<li>They may use syntax that may be objectionable to some developers.</li>
<li>Some developers may find the syntax difficult to read.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons it is often best to go with the most simple, basic set of conventions possible, based on obvious patterns.</p>
<h4 id="a-simple-css-code-pattern">A Simple CSS Code Pattern</h4>
<!-- Isobar Component Pattern 
    This entire section might be best left out, I don't know if it goes 
    too far for the document? From there down to "Utilities"
-->

<p>The following sections describe one simple approach, and as long as the types are defined on a project and the patterns are followed, then a clear meaning can be interpreted fairly quickly and easily reading through the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Every site will have distinct requirements but some examples of things that can be standardized on a site build include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Defaults</li>
<li>Page Level Rules (grids, site template types, and so on)</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Modifiers</li>
<li>State</li>
<li>JavaScript-only Rules</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe how some might work.</p>
<h5 id="global-defaults">Global Defaults</h5>
<p>For the purposes of discussion we could refer to the global defaults as the baseline HTML elements and their associated styles. Frequently you may wish to use a third party library which normalizes CSS behavior accross browsers. Either way, it makes sense to keep these files in their own files.</p>
<h5 id="page-level-rules">Page Level Rules</h5>
<!-- need more content here -->

<p>Any site is liable to have a standard baseline set of grids and types of pages. These grids can be collected into their own distinct set of component files — using a broad definition of a global &quot;thing&quot; as a component.</p>
<h5 id="components">Components</h5>
<p>Components are a high level concept for organizing CSS files and rules. A component simply means a grouped set of rules pertaining to an object or set of related objects on a page.</p>
<p>Additionally, encapsulating these components into distinct files is a great option. Within this file, using a naming convention is a tremendous help here for code maintainability and readability. </p>
<p>Group styles under a simple namespace using a <strong>prefix-suffix-modifier</strong> type pattern such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* core component */
.component { ... }

/* component elements */
.component-header { ... }
.component-content { ... }

/* component descendant */
.component-content-group { ... }

/* component descendant element */
.component-content-group-header { ... }
.component-content-group-imgs { ... }</code></pre>
<p>This type of pattern is easy to read, extend, and follow in the absence of something more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Addionally, generally components will be the only CSS class with distinct names that do not have prefixes before the core, root, or base name of the component (e.g. above we are usin <code>component</code>).</p>
<p>Just to get developers thinking, these might be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>navbar</li>
<li>footer</li>
<li>page-info</li>
<li>article-date</li>
<li>lead</li>
<li>widgetfoo</li>
<li>byline</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h5>
<p>If you need to extend an existing component then create distinct modifier classes with the prefix <code>mod-</code> to easily indicate that it is a modifier and not a complete style. Using the <code>mod</code> name prefix prevents confusing the class with a full class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.mod-modifier-a { ... }
.mod-modifier-b { ... }</code></pre>
<p>Then, when used in the HTML, the class stands out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div class=&quot;component-content mod-modifier-a&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This is a strong technique because the modifier classes can stand on their own in the CSS. Further, they may also be altered via more complex rules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.component-header.mod-modifier-a { ... }</code></pre>
<p>This is simplistic and easy to follow, understand, and expand upon.</p>
<h5 id="state">State</h5>
<p>A <em>state</em> for an element or component is presentation information for a given component. This may be a dynamic state set by JavaScript or a user interaction, but not always. It could also be a preset from the server or the results after a transaction. State modifiers are a great way for a distinct class to be provided to engineers unfamilar with the design to be provided hooks for various things. This is slightly different than JS specific classes, however.</p>
<p>State rules will use the <code>is-</code> prefix.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.component-group.is-full { ... } 
.component-group.is-expired { ... }</code></pre>
<p>Treating components&#39; <em>state</em> as a modifier that is boolean (i.e. <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semanticallly helps provide information about the content.</li>
<li>Separates the code for state from default presentation.</li>
<li>Removes the need to update corresponding states or components if the name of either changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last point is important from a maintenance perspective.</p>
<p>It&#39;s best to try to restrict these state indicators as being restricted to a specific component.</p>
<h5 id="javascript-js-prefix">JavaScript (JS) Prefix</h5>
<p>The usage of a <code>js-</code> prefix is present in the markup but should never really appear in the CSS file itself. If the styles are being set, then use modifiers or state type classes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;button class=&quot;component-button js-execute&quot;&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>js-execute</code> rule should not appear in the CSS file, but only in JS files they are tied to behavior. These are events, verbs, or action related, and are access points for JavaScript not a toggle or state changer. It&#39;s best to think of these classes as closer to and ID attribute in the html.</p>
<h5 id="utilities">Utilities</h5>
<p>A utility is a type of component modifier that is specifically designed to be used on more than one component type. If it was restricted to a single component, it would simply be a modifier.</p>
<p>Utilities will use the prefix of <code>u-</code> and should serve only the modifier purpose intended without side effects when applied to any component, or component decendant.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="class">.u-warning</span> <span class="rules">{

<span class="rule">}</span></span>
<span class="class">.u-scroll-infobox</span> <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">overflow-x</span>:<span class="value"> scroll</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">width</span>:<span class="value"> auto</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>

<h3 id="css-deliverables">CSS Deliverables</h3>
<p>Please be aware of potential conflicts between the original development environment for CSS and an ultimate deployment to production systems, if continuous integration will allow the continued use of CSS preprocessors, or if there should a cross-platform development strategy.</p>
<p>Delivered CSS should be concatenated, minified, tested against browser bugs (e.g. MSIE selector count bugs) and extra files should be removed.</p>
<p>File naming conventions should be consistent and language or use-case specific files should be clear and not be easily confused with the global style CSS.</p>

</section>
<section><h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is where extra behaviors, features, and functionality not offered natively by Web browsers through CSS and HTML is created. </p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>JavaScript should be used carefully and deliberately. Any and all JavaScript code that&#39;s added to a Web page should be there <em>if and only if</em> it is necessary for the page to achieve the desired ends.</p>
<p>JavaScript should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>included deliberately, after careful consideration </li>
<li>have the performance overhead and file size evaluated</li>
<li>have a feature set that is clearly understood</li>
<li>perform only the necessary tasks</li>
<li>have maintainability carefully assessed</li>
<li>following patterns established for the project</li>
<li>tested in various devices and platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, the absense of the code should be carefully considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if for some reason this code is missing or does not run? </li>
<li>What happens if the code triggers an error?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please understand what the JavaScript does and how it does it if you are including third party code.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>Client buy-in may be necessary for the usage of JavaScript for various features. It may be a forgone conclusion but usage of libraries or custom code should be discussed with the team and client technical leads for various features.</p>
<h4 id="javascript-libraries">JavaScript Libraries</h4>
<p>It is quite common for different libraries and frameworks be used on projects.</p>
<h4 id="have-control-over-the-page-lifecycle">Have Control Over the Page Lifecycle</h4>
<ul>
<li>Single execution and entry point</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="understanding-the-code-s-place-in-the-project">Understanding the Code&#39;s Place in the Project</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understand where your code will live vs. any code introduced in a destination environment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="javascript-standards">JavaScript Standards</h3>
<h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>
<p>Use the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to include your JavaScript files at the bottom of your HTML document just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. For optimal page performance, concatenate your JavaScript into as few files as possible.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="formatting">Formatting</h4>
<p>The use of whitespace should follow long-standing English writing conventions. Specifically, each comma and colon (and semi-colons that don&#39;t end a line) should be followed by a single space. Binary and ternary operators should have a single space on each side. There should be no space characters between parentheses and their contents. Opening braces should appear on the same line as their preceding argument.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>, len = arr.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
    <span class="comment">// do something</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>To maximize readability without worrying about which boolean operators bind more tightly than others, each segment of a boolean expression should be enclosed in parentheses.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">if</span> ((allowUpdate) &amp;&amp; ((user.isAdmin) || (user.role === item.owner))) {
    <span class="comment">// do something</span>
}</code></pre>
<h4 id="variable-declaration">Variable Declaration</h4>
<p>To avoid confusion between global and local variables, we declare each variable on its own line with the <code>var</code> keyword. We do not use a single <code>var</code> keyword and then chain several variable declarations onto it separated by a comma.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> currentVal = $(<span class="keyword">this</span>).val();
<span class="keyword">var</span> min = parseInt($(<span class="keyword">this</span>).attr(<span class="string">'min'</span>), <span class="number">10</span>);
<span class="keyword">var</span> max = parseInt($(<span class="keyword">this</span>).attr(<span class="string">'max'</span>), <span class="number">10</span>);</code></pre>
<h4 id="feature-detection">Feature Detection</h4>
<p>Always test for the existence of a browser API, function, or object property before you use it, and make sure the user experience is still functional (to the extent possible) if it&#39;s not found. We rely on JavaScript-based feature detection rather than server-side device detection because it&#39;s more robust, easily maintained, and future-proof.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="media-queries">Media Queries</h4>
<ul>
<li>Media Queries are supported by most browsers</li>
<li>IE8 and below are problematic.<ul>
<li>IE8 doesn’t support Media Queries.</li>
<li>There are ways to get around this which involve adding conditional comments for each individual stylesheet breakpoint - I don’t like this approach. It means that all browsers will need an extra http request for each stylesheet</li>
<li>Instead, use Respond.js to enable Media Query support</li>
<li>Read the documentation to find known bugs and tips</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All modern browsers support CSS3 Media Queries (even as far back as the stock Android 2.1 browser)<ul>
<li>In order to test for Media Query Support in JS, use the MatchMedia polyfill that’s found in Modernizr.</li>
<li>Use this fork of MatchMedia() which supports IE8</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking Media Query support via JS<ul>
<li>Media Queries in stylesheets are all well and good, but what if you need to test media query support in your Javascript?</li>
<li>User Modernizr’s Modernizr.mq() function</li>
<li>NOTE: This intentionally doesn’t work in IE8.</li>
<li>The creators of this plugin generally advise against the use of complex polyfills to enable support in older versions of IE. THe primary reason is that it will cause yet another performance hit in an already slow Javascript and rendering engine. Instead, craft your code so that IE8 defaults to the desktop version.</li>
<li>Modernize has Modernizr.mq(), but its support is flaky in &lt;= IE8.</li>
</ul>
</li>
